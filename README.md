# OnsenUI-dist
Bower and NPM distribution repository for Onsen UI.

## Download Onsen UI

Using bower:

```bash
$ bower install onsenui
```

Using npm:

```bash
$ npm install onsenui
```

## How to tag a new release

These releases are generated by [dist-release.sh](https://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/blob/master/scripts/dist-release.sh) script. Once the files are modified and ready to be relased simply run the script from OnsenUI directory:

```bash
./dist-release.sh [no-build]
```
Add `no-build` option to skip `gulp build` OnsenUI in case it's already built. This script will install required dependencies, build css-components + OnsenUI and upload a new tag to OnsenUI-dist repository using the version listed in `package.json`.
